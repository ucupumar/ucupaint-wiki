Ucupaint is addon to manage texture as layers Requirements You need at least blender 2.79 to use this addon, but more advance features only available on the modern version blender (2.80 & above). This addon works with both eevee and cycles. Installation Go to github.com/ucupumar/ucupaint/releases, and download according to your blender version Go to blender user preferences, add-ons tabs and choose install, browse your downloaded addon and click install add-on Limitations It can be really slow if you have a lot of layers with a lot of channels Layer group can make it even slower Since blender already have plan to add texture layer features built-in when I write this, when it's already available to use, you should probably use that instead, it's basically do the same thing","title":"INTRODUCTION TO UCUPAINT"},{"location":"#introduction-to-ucupaint","text":"","title":"INTRODUCTION TO UCUPAINT"},{"location":"#what-is-ucupaint","text":"Ucupaint is addon to manage texture as layers","title":"What is ucupaint?"},{"location":"#requirements","text":"You need at least blender 2.79 to use this addon, but more advance features only available on the modern version blender (2.80 & above).
